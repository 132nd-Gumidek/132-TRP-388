>  **note191123: some parts here is out of scope, it's very easy to drop into general mission planning considerations. I think the document should contain itself to basically IP to EGRESS, right now the first chapter is called "planning your mission" instead of planning your attack**. 

> **note191123: TTP-6, 12, 13 all pertain mission planning considerations and check-lists**  


# 1. Introduction 
**Scope:** This document outlines the Tactics Techniques and Procedures (TTP's) for **surface attacks** with fast jets  in the 132nd Virtual Wing. Each squadron ~~will~~ have their own Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's) for aircraft squadron specifics in regards to surface attacks.  
**Content:** ~~This document is divided into X chapters. Chapter 1 describes the planning process for a successful surface attack. Chapter 2 contains useful information. Chapter 3 contains [blank]~~  
**Pilot responsibility:** Use common sense. TTP's describe technical and tactical procedures for most circumstances, but is no substitute for common sense and judgment. It is the pilot's responsibility to fly the aircraft safely and effectively in all circumstances, as required to accomplish the mission.  
**Deviations:** Deviations from these TTP's are approved as long as they are communicated to all parties operating together.  
**Recommended changes:** Improvements and recommended changes to this TTP should be stated to the Wing Command Staff.

> Note that whilst all these factors and guidelines are applicable during AR/SCAR/CAS missions, the dynamic nature of those missions often deny you access to information beforehand.


### <a name='Targetstudy'></a>Target study
The study of the target.
Prior to any mission you should gather all available information, maps, imagery and intelligence. Information can be found in various sources such as the mission brief, Air Tasking Order (ATO),  target packs, DCS Mission Editor or Combat Flite. 

 
You want to look at the overall target area. Use DCS Mission Editor or Combat Flite maps and various target photos to “see” the position of the target from a “big picture perspective.” This is very important. You might choose to approach your target at high speed and at low altitude, where your radius of vision is limited. Your attention will be split between navigation concerns and analysing, interpreting, and possibly responding to enemy threats.

Your “big picture” study has one purpose, you want to locate significant navigational references that you will use to “walk” your eyes to the target. As an explanation, let’s say the target is a truck convoy located near a bridge. As you run in to the immediate target area, you first locate the river. You follow the river until you get a tally on the bridge. You know from your target study that the truck convoy is situated in a particular direction from the bridge. Use your run in heading to the bridge as a twelve o’clock reference. Then translate the target’s location relative to the bridge into a clock position. For example, as you approach the bridge, you look to the bridge’s nine o’clock to find the target. Use this step-by-step process to get your eyes on the target in a methodical manner. Do not leave it to luck or chance to find your target. Your map and target photos make it possible to build your mental picture of this “big picture.” Using the “big picture to specific target” technique helps you find your target quickly, leaving you additional time to devote to achieving a successful one-pass attack.  

Now, let’s consider what the target actually looks like. Use your maps and target photos to get a general picture of the target layout. See how long the target is. Then you can decide on ripple and spacing. Notice the colour of the target. This might help during the day. A dark building can be found nicely when it has a light background. Try to find out what the elevation of the target is. What is the weather like? Can you see the target when you are at 3.000 feet? This will give you the first ideas of which attack profile to choose.  

Using the convoy again as an example, determine if the convoy is strung out in a line or grouped together like a herd of cattle. Note the general compass orientation of the target. Determine if your attack heading will take you down the length of the convoy or across it. This heading is called your “attack axis.” Your weapon effectiveness is affected by your choice of attack axis. For example, when using CBU bomblets, you want to spread the bomblets along the length of the convoy rather than across it. Your target study may give you the location of that threat in the convoy. 

Area defences, analyse any known positions of AAA, SAM’s and radar stations. 

Target area weather.

Sun and moon, locate the sun or moon's position in the sky, and factor this into your desired attack/egress heading.

Select (if able) your requested ordnance based on.
* Desired effect (Probability of kill "PK")
* Desired delivery type (factored by weather, threat, frag)
* Target priority ($)
* Weather
* CDE (Collateral Damage Estimates)

* Target area threat picture
* Weather 
* Weapon release envelope
* Element of surprise

### <a name='Finalattackheadingandinitialpoint.'></a>Final attack heading and initial point.

**Final attack heading (FAH)** this is on the heading you want to be when employing your weapons.  
Selection criterias for FAH:
* Target layout (elongated targets ie:. bridges, runways, ships, defensive lines, roads)
* Geographical hindrance (terrain, buildings)
* Sun and moon position
* CDE (Collateral Damage Estimates)
* LTL (Laser Target Line)


**Initial Point (IP)** the IP is where the attack(run) commences, at this point your aircraft should be fully configured for the attack and established within the ingress parameters of your attack profile. The IP in relation to your target also generates your attack-axis, the direction you approach your target from.  
Selection criterias for IP:
* Unique geographical reference suitable for altitude (high/medium(horizontal); lake, crossroads. low(vertical): hills, tower)
* Correct attack axis that complies with FAH (not necessarily direct)
* Approximately 2-3 minutes distance from weapons release
* Attack-Axis supporting visual acquisition of target


> Note that in CAS and other Dynamic scenarios, the IP can be your current position during time sensitive attacks.

> Remember to never fly straight and level in a hostile environment.

### <a name='Egressheading'></a>Egress heading

This is the pre-briefed heading your flight takes after employment and safe escape manoeuvre (SEM).  
Egress heading considerations:  
* Threat
* Geographical cover
* Landmarks

> Egress heading is often referred to as OFF, from off target. "off left", "off reference 270"

### <a name='Poststrikerendezvouspoint'></a>Post strike rendezvous point


Post strike rendezvous point (RV) is a grid or geographical reference point where the flight rejoins post-strike if they are unable to do so visually during egress. A deconflicted post-strike RV should be pre-briefed.  
RV planning considerations:  
* Threat
* Risk/Reward (prolonged exposure v.s. flight integrity)  
* Weather

> Operating under EMCON, Comms Jamming, Battle damage, Defensive manoeuvres

### <a name='Attacktactics'></a>Attack tactics
Now we are getting down to the “nitty-gritty.” The best attack plan is one that assures target destruction and maximizes the enemy’s surprise and confusion. The attack phase starts at the IP. Plan your run in to do two things…approach the target unobserved or undetected and, if you have additional flight members, from opposite attack directions. Use terrain masking to best advantage. You can split your four ship into two elements to attack from opposing directions at the same time. If you are in a two ship, you can still do this and remain in visual support for each other.

Your choice of attack plan will hinge directly on the threat level of enemy defenses in the target area. We divide our tactics into two types either “high threat” or “low threat”. A high threat situation typically includes SAMs and radar controlled, large caliber (37mm and above) AAA, while a low threat area is generally thought of as one having only small arms, light AAA, or man-portable SAMs.

**Tactics For A High Threat Environment**  
If the target is well defended by SAMs and AAA, then plan a low altitude attack using terrain masking. Two attacks that work well in a high threat environment are “shooter-cover” and “decoy.” “Shooter-cover” means one pilot attacks the target while the other looks for a threat and then attacks the threat if necessary. In a “decoy” attack, one pilot (or flight, if attacking in elements) exposes himself to the threat while the other pilot attacks from a different direction. “Decoy” works particularly well against the sim’s SAM AI. Use stand-off weapons or delivery methods whenever possible. Maverick missiles are excellent against threats in a “shooter-cover” attack. Use “toss” deliveries for freefall weapons. Avoid overflight of the target if at all possible. The pop-up attack is a favored maneuver for these tactics.  

The pop-up attack is a often flown tactic in the low altitude, high threat environment. It works well with both shooter-cover and decoy attacks. The target is approached at minimum altitude and at weapons release airspeed or higher. At this time the target may not be in sight. At approximately three miles from the target, the attacking pilot begins a climb, acquires the target, and then rolls inverted and pulls down to the desired dive angle for the attack. The cover or decoy pilot flies a similar maneuver and offsets his flight path as necessary from the attacker. The cover pilot offsets only enough to establish visual contact with the target area, and begins his pop-up at the same time as the attacker. The decoy pilot takes a greater offset…he typically turns away 30 degrees from the attacker and times his turn back towards the target to achieve approximately a 90 degree difference in attack heading. The decoy pilot begins his pop-up before the attacker…the objective is to draw the defender’s attention well away from the direction the attacker will come from.  

The pop-up attack is often thought of as a “fast mover” attack profile. In the traditional sense, the attack is planned in great detail using large scale maps. The attack profile is planned for a specific dive angle and release altitude…math formulas are used to compute the required distances from the target. The calculations are used to find the “pop” point and the “pull down” point. Once these are known, the map is used to plan an approach to the pop point. A ground feature close to the pop point will be used as a close-in IP. The pilot will fly over that point on a specific heading and hack his clock. The pilot will have computed a “fly off” time to fly from this IP. When that time expires, the pilot will be at the planned pop point. He then goes full power, pulls up to a pre-planned climb angle, and stays on his approach heading. Once at the desired climb angle, he unloads and watches his altimeter as he looks for the target. With the target in sight, the pilot then continues his climb to the planned “pull down” altitude. At this altitude, he then rolls inverted and begins his pull towards the target. The wait for the pull down altitude ensures the pilot is on or close to the pre-planned dive angle. Once pointed at the target, the pilot makes any necessary last second aiming corrections prior to releasing his weapon.  

**Tactics For A Low Threat Environment**  
In a low threat environment, use medium altitude tactics to stay out of the AAA threat. As a general rule, stay above 5,000’ above target elevation to remain clear of most small arms and light AAA. Trail formation is a good low threat choice. Orbit the target in a “wheel” and attack individually. Plan for thirty seconds separation between each flight member’s attack for frag avoidance. ~~If your sim includes “smart” weapons, the low threat environment is optimum for their use.~~

> note191123: conflicts with previousely mentioned never attack target twice, which is very AI centric.

**Weapons Frag Envelope**  
Regardless of which attack profile you fly, at some point you are going to have to deliver the weapon. Many weapons require the attacking aircraft to overfly the target area. This results in the need for the attacker to be aware of and avoid the destructive effects of his own weapon. Each weapon has a fragmentation (frag) envelope. This envelope has three parameters…height above ground, length or width, and duration in seconds. Plan your weapons release to avoid flying through the effects of your own weapon’s explosion or through another pilot’s weapon’s frag envelope.
The best way to avoid fragging yourself is to follow the minimum release altitude info. Do not continue your dive below release altitude.  Avoid fragging your wingman by separating your attacks on a common target by at least thirty seconds or by simultaneously attacking targets that are at least one half mile apart.  

**Re-Attack Considerations**
A re-attack of the target should be avoided if possible. If a re-attack cannot be avoided, then do not repeat the initial attack plan. Exit the target area, and use a new IP if you can., you can expect the enemy to be ready for you the second time around. Since you can expect target area defenses to be at the ready, your second attack should emphasize threat suppression along with target destruction. Use shooter-cover or decoy tactics.

### <a name='Ingressconsiderations'></a>Ingress considerations

> note191123 ingress last, makes little sense




### <a name='Contingencies'></a>Contingencies
**Threat reactions**  
Your study of the threat will help you anticipate any threat indications that you may encounter during the mission. In particular, be prepared to quickly identify enemy SAM threats. Know the difference between being “painted” (“DIRT”) by enemy radar versus being locked up (“MUD”)  versus actually being fired at. While being “painted” is never a comfortable feeling, it may not require a defensive reaction. On the other hand, a “launch” warning is a serious matter and almost always will require a defensive reaction. Decide ahead of time what you will do for a given threat indication. Your defensive reactions vary from doing nothing in response to a minor radar scan to the jettisoning of your ordnance, followed by a break turn to avoid a missile in the air. The ramifications of the magnitude of these reactions to your overall attack plan should be clear. An improper defensive reaction brought about by an erroneous reading and reaction to a perceived enemy threat can result in a blown mission just as surely as if you had been shot down.


**Ingress “Fight or Flight”**  
Let’s consider whether or not your ingress to the target is unopposed. What are the implications of an attack on your flight as you make your way to the target? Should you engage, or should you attempt to avoid contact? Your decision may hinge on factors beyond your control. You may not have the fuel to engage in defensive manoeuvring. You may not be carrying weapons suitable for a prolonged defensive engagement. The “fight or flight” decision must be made beforehand. Know your mission fuel and time limitations. Decide ahead of time what you will do in a given defensive situation.

**Loss Of Flight Member / Abort Criteria**  
Know what you will do if a flight member is shot down or has to return to base. If you are planning a four ship mission, then have a three ship back up plan. This may require different formations and attack tactics. Realize that the flight lead may be the one to get shot down. Make sure you have another flight member ready to step in as the new flight lead. At some point, you may not have enough flight members to complete the mission. Decide upon an abort plan and be ready to use it. It is foolhardy to press on if you do not have enough munitions on the remaining aircraft to destroy your target.


 

## <a name='WeaponDeliveryMethods'></a>Weapon Delivery Methods 

> **note191123 bit of chaos in order, below**

### <a name='Gundeliveries'></a>Gun deliveries 

Low Angle Strafe (LAS)
Planned dive angle at delivery of 15 degrees or less. Minimum range to target is 2,000 feet. Minimum recovery altitude is 75 feet AGL. Number of rounds per event is 100. 

LAS deliveries are most effective against soft/lightly-armoured targets and will normally result in a higher dispersion of bullet impacts than high angle deliveries. The lower dive angle used on LAS deliveries allow for both lower aircraft speeds and operation at lower altitudes without the need for a pop-up profile, this allow the aircraft to carry out multiple passes on a single target in rapid succession and often allow the pilot to maintain visual contact with the target area throughout the attack. LAS deliveries are also ideal for attacking soft target such as supply convoys and troops with or without PAC.

The main disadvantages of LAS deliveries are increased exposure to enemy fire due to the low altitude and short range to the target, as well as relatively high bullet dispersion patterns resulting in reduced effectiveness against armoured targets.



High Angle Strafe (HAS)
Planned dive angle of greater than 15 degrees. Minimum recovery altitudes are 1,000 feet AGL for planned dive angles 30 degrees or less and 1,500 feet AGL for planned dive angles above 30 degrees. Minimum range to target is 2,000 feet. Number of rounds per event is 100.

HAS deliveries are most effective against heavily armoured targets such as main battle tanks and will normally result in a low dispersion of bullet impacts. HAS deliveries are also ideal for point targets where a tight bullet impact pattern is desired and/or where targets are located in mountainous terrain.

The main disadvantages of HAS deliveries are a limited tracking time due to the high aircraft speed in the dive and the need for an early escape manoeuvre to recover from the dive. It can also be difficult to maintain visual contact with the target due to the requirement for a high starting altitude. The need for a high starting altitude also places the aircraft at risk of early detection and/or high risk of engagement by SAM/AAA systems during the attack.


### <a name='LowLevelDeliveries'></a>Low Level Deliveries

Visual Level Delivery (VLD)
The VLD is a level delivery with a release angle of less than five degrees of climb or dive; it is often performed at very low level (sub 1000 ft. AGL) utilising high drag munitions such as the MK-82AIR. 
The minimum recovery altitude is the safe escape/fuse arm range for the ordnance being delivered, or 200 feet AGL, whichever is higher. 

In training pilots will not descend below the specific range altitude if higher than stated above. Training hit criteria for a VLD are as follows: 125 feet (38 meters) for a computed delivery and 250 feet (76 meters) for a manual delivery.

The VLD is of somewhat limited use in the A-10C as the aircraft’s comparatively low airspeed means it remains in proximity to the target and any defences for a longer period of time than other higher performance aircraft, however for targets where the primary threat is medium/high altitude SAM systems it is still useful. Unlike pop-up deliveries (see below) the VLD is flown at a near constant altitude from ingress to the end of the SEM (and normally egress). The VLD will normally be used in situations where a NOE ingress and egress is required and only one attack on the target (per aircraft) is planned. When multiple aircraft will be attacking the same target, time and heading separation is vital it order to prevent following aircraft passing through any fragmentation and deny the enemy the ability to predict the arrival of attackers.

Low Angle High Drag (LAHD) 
An LAHD attack, as the name would suggest is performed using high drag munitions such as the MK-82AIR, it is also used to deliver CBUs from low level. The delivery itself is carried out with a dive angle of less than 30 degrees and the minimum recovery altitude is safe escape/fuse arm for ordnance being delivered, one-half the computed altitude loss during dive recovery or 100 feet AGL, whichever is higher. 

Training hit criteria are 75 feet (23 meters) for a computed delivery and 105 feet (32 meters) for a manual delivery.

The LAHD delivery is usually performed with a low level ingress, similar to the VLD above, but rather than remaining at a constant altitude a “pop-up” is performed on the final ingress. This allows the attacking aircraft to remain at low level and utilize terrain masking (where possible) to remain out of range of any defenses at the target until the last possible moment. The aggressive nature of a pop-up followed by a dive attack further reduces the attacking aircraft’s exposure to ground fire, especially when combined with a low level egress.
‘
Low Angle Low Drag (LALD)
An LALD attack is similar to the LAHD outlined above; it is also performed with a dive angle of less than 30 degrees and can be performed following a “pop-up”, although it can also be initiated from a level ingress at a higher altitude. The main difference is the weapon type used, whereas the LAHD is carried out with high drag munitions, the LALD (as the name would suggest) is performed with low drag munitions such as the standard MK-82 or MK-82AIRs in low drag configuration. The minimum recovery altitude is the safe escape/fuse arm height for the ordnance being employed, or 800 ft. AGL, whichever is higher.

Training hit criteria is 100 feet (31 meters) for a computed delivery and 175 feet (53 meters) for a manual delivery.

The LALD delivery can be performed with a low level ingress and a “pop-up” on the final ingress or from a higher altitude without a pop-up. The main noticeable difference between an LALD and LAHD delivery is the altitude, at which the weapons are released, or the attack aborted, and the SEM must be carried out due to the reduced flight time and shallower flight path of the low drag munitions employed. This means that when performed with a pop-up from low level the climb is longer in duration and/or steeper. This may make a pop-up LALD impossible in the A-10C depending on aircraft weight/pressure altitude etc. and consideration should be given to these factors when planning such deliveries.

### <a name='DiveBombDB'></a>Dive Bomb (DB)
The Dive Bomb delivery is probably the most familiar to the majority of pilots; it is performed with a dive angle of between 30 and 60 degrees and from a higher initial altitude than either LAHD or LALD. Although it could be carried out following a “pop-up”, due to the higher dive angle and therefore minimum recovery altitude it would be difficult to accomplish in a low speed low power aircraft such as the A-10C as the climb would need to be much steeper/longer. The minimum recovery altitude is the safe escape or fuse arm height for the ordnance being simulated, or as required to recover above 1,000 ft. AGL, whichever is higher. 

Training hit criteria is 85 ft. (26 meters) for a computed delivery and 145 ft. (44 meters) for a manual delivery.

The DB delivery is one of the most common delivery types for the A-10C and is a very accurate method of delivering weapons using CCIP. It should be noted however that due to the higher ingress altitude terrain masking is normally impossible and extreme care should be taken in high threat environments, as the delivery will bring the attacking aircraft well inside the MANPADS and AAA WEZ. Mutual support is vital to ensuring the safety of the attacking aircraft, and wingmen should be positioned in a way that allows a clear view of the target and the attacking aircraft’s ingress, attack and egress.


### <a name='MediumLevelDeliveries'></a>Medium Level Deliveries

High Altitude Dive Bomb (HADB) 
The HADB is almost identical to the Dive Bomb outlined in the previous chapter; the only real difference between the two delivery methods is the altitudes at which they are performed. Like the DB the HADB is performed with a planned dive angle of between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, but with a minimum recovery altitude of at least 4,500 ft. AGL. 

Training hit criteria is 125 ft. (38 meters) for a computed delivery and 250 ft. (76 meters) for a manual delivery.

The HADB, like the DB, is a very accurate method of delivering dumb munitions on target but due to the higher altitude at which it is performed it reduces the risk to the delivery aircraft from SHORAD systems such as AAA or MANPADS. It should be noted that 4,500 ft. AGL is the minimum recovery altitude for the HADB delivery and pilots/flight leads can set a higher minimum recovery altitude if desired/appropriate. When performing a HADB delivery it is vital that the pilot pays attention to the altitude and airspeed in the dive, as well as the amount of time spent tracking the target. It is all too easy to become fixated on the target, ignore the HUD RTSE cues and then find yourself below the minimum recovery altitude in the range of the SHORAD systems you were hoping to avoid, or even colliding with the terrain. The tracking phase of HADB deliveries should be less than 6 seconds; excessive time spent in the dive trying to force the pipper on the target from a poorly executed dive/turn is without doubt the biggest mistake pilots make.


High Altitude Release Bomb (HARB) 
HARB is a diving delivery with a planned dive angle of 30 degrees or greater, just like DB and HADB, where it differs is the minimum recovery altitude (and therefore the release altitude). The minimum recovery altitude for a HARB delivery is 10,000 ft. AGL, twice the height of the HADB. 

Training hit criteria is 255 ft. (78 meters) for a computed delivery and 510 ft. (136 meters) for a manual delivery. 

~~The HARB is not a delivery method which will be employed by the A-10C very often as it is primarily used by fighter aircraft attacking large, heavily defended targets.~~ Due to the high release altitude, and therefore large slant range, accuracy is limited (despite still being a CCIP delivery) which means the HARB is of limited value when attacking small, mobile targets such as vehicles and troops. It is worth noting however, that HARB may be useful in cases where it is important to get weapons on target but the threat situation makes a low level attack inappropriate. When planning such a delivery the reduced accuracy should be considered and thought given to using multiple aircraft against a single DMPI to ensure sufficient weapons impact the target in order to achieve the desired effect.


### <a name='TossDeliveries'></a>Toss Deliveries 
Weapon delivery in which an aircraft system is used for target designation followed by a climbing Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) weapon release. It should be noted that toss deliveries are generally less accurate.

#### <a name='LowAltitudeTossLAT'></a>Low Altitude Toss (LAT) 
LAT deliveries involve a release altitude below 10,000 ft. AGL all the way down to 0 ft. AGL. The minimum recovery is the safe escape altitude/distance for the ordnance being delivered. 


The LAT delivery is the most accurate CCRP delivery as the low release altitude limits the effect of wind and aiming error on the weapons during their flight. While easier to perform than a diving CCIP delivery, the LAT delivery is also less accurate and may require releasing more weapons and/or more attacks to deliver the same damage to the target as a single diving delivery. Due to the release aircraft’s attitude and airspeed at the point of weapon release, the weapon time of flight will be greater than a diving delivery with the same release altitude.

As it already says, this is a low altitude profile. The idea for this delivery is to fly in low and below the radar and also give you some distance from the target at the same time. You will toss the bombs from a distance and turn away before you over fly the target. This will give you the advantaged of surprise and you stay as far as possible from the target. The disadvantage of this delivery is that the accuracy is lower then the other modes. So you have to select this profile only when everything fits to the occasion. Using guided weapons is a good option, and also cluster bombs will fit very nice. Dumb bombs are not so good for this profile because you will probably miss the target unless the target is very large like a hanger.


#### <a name='MediumAltitudeTossMAT'></a>Medium Altitude Toss (MAT) 
A MAT delivery is identical to the LAT described above but with a release altitude of 10,000 ft. AGL or above. The minimum recovery is the safe escape altitude/distance for the ordnance being delivered.

Training hit criteria is 300 ft. (91 meters).

The MAT delivery has the same list of pro’s and con’s as the LAT, the notable difference being the higher altitude magnifies the effects of wind and aiming error on weapon accuracy. While the higher altitude may negate the threat posed by AAA and/or MANPADS it should be considered that it makes the delivery aircraft and even better target for hostile aircraft and MERAD/LORAD systems.


### <a name='Mediumhighaltitudetactics.'></a>Medium/high altitude tactics. 
Are flown above 8,000ft above ground level(AGL). High altitude bombing can be described as bombing with the height of release over 15,000 ft AGL.
Attack.  
Types of delivery  
**Level:** Used for guided and unguided free-fall weapons. Release point may have bomb ranges outside of visual range.   
**Dive:** Used for guided, unguided and forward firing ordnance, these dive deliveries typically use dive 	angles of 15 to 60 degrees. 
	 


### <a name='Lowverylowaltitudetactics'></a>Low/very low altitude tactics
Are flown below 8,000ft AGL. Low altitude bombing can be described as bombing with height of release between 500 and 8,000ft AGL. These tactics are employed when threat system capabilities and/or weather conditions preclude aircraft operating at higher altitudes.
Attack. Types of delivery
Level: Deliver ordnance with a wings level pass over the target
 
Loft: To execute a loft delivery the flight proceeds inbound to the target from the IP. At a 	calculated point the aircrew starts a loft maneuver pull up. Once released the weapon continues an 	upward trajectory while the aircrew executes follow-on tactics or egresses from the target area.
 



Pop-up: To execute a pop-up delivery the CAS flight proceeds to the target from the IP at low/very 	low altitude. As the CAS flight nears the target, they pop-up to the desired altitude and execute a 	level or dive delivery.

 


Dive deliveries: Used for both free fall and forward firing ordnance. These deliveries use dive angles of 5 to 45 degrees.




Pop-up deliveries

Low Angle Low Drag Bombing (LALD) (10º–20º)
The delivery is designed for low-angle delivery of low-drag weapons. Exercise care in computing
release altitudes to assure fuze arming and safe escape. Planned angle-off for this type of delivery can 
vary from 15º–90º, although optimum angle is approximately 2 x climb angle. Accomplish pull-up to the
planned climb angle (15º + 5º and 20º + 10º) and pull-down at the preplanned pull-down altitude. Take
care to properly monitor the altimeter to determine the proper pull-down point since the apex altitude for a
LALD delivery is considerably higher than for a LAHD delivery and visual cues can be deceiving. For
CCIP deliveries roll out with the target approximately halfway between the FPM and CCIP pipper. Pay special attention to the altimeter to assure you deliver at or above the planned altitude.



Low Angle High Drag Bombing (LAHD) (10º–15º)
This attack maneuver is very similar to that of low-angle strafe. It is designed for low-angle delivery
of high drag weapons. The approach to the target is normally planned to be made from a run-in heading
offset 15º–30º from the attack heading at a minimum of 450 KCAS. At the desired pop point, a 3–4 G
pull-up is initiated to the planned climb angle (usually dive angle plus 5º). At the preplanned pull-down
altitude, the aircraft should be rolled towards the target and the nose pulled down to roll out just as you
would in any low angle bomb delivery. Normally, this type of delivery is planned to allow 3–5 seconds of
tracking/designate time prior to arriving at planned release altitude. For CCIP deliveries, roll out with the
target approximately one-third down between the FPM and CCIP pipper.
.


Low Angle Strafe (LAS)
Although the planned angle-off from the target can vary, normally the approach to the target is
planned to be 15º–30º from the desired attack heading at a minimum of 450 KCAS. At the planned pop
point, select military power and begin a 3–4 G pull-up to the desired climb angle. This is normally
planned to be equal to the planned delivery dive angle plus 5º. At the preplanned pull-down altitude, roll
the aircraft and begin a pull-down to achieve the desired dive angle. Monitoring the HUD pitch lines in
relation to the target will simplify achieving the planned dive angle. Make an unloaded roll out with the
CCIP pipper approximately 100' short of the target. After roll out, track and fire just as in a
curvilinear/box strafing pass.

High Altitude Dive Bombing (HADB) (30º–45º)  
This delivery is designed for high angle delivery of low-drag weapons in a high threat environment.
During mission planning, aircraft configuration must be taken into account to ensure this type of approach
is feasible, i.e., two wing tanks with six MK 82s may not be an option for high 45º delivery. The
approach to the target is normally at 500 KCAS (minimum) to an action point 4–5 NM short of the target.
At this point, a check turn between 20º–30º is required to obtain the necessary offset. At the desired pop
point, a 4 G pull-up is initiated to the planning climb angle (usually dive angle plus 15º) in full AB. Once
the pop-up is established, time should be devoted to target acquisition which can be difficult since you will
be looking down over the canopy rail. Monitor the altimeter as the pull down altitude approaches due to
the rapid climb rate to ensure correct parameters. At the apex, the aircraft will be at or nearly inverted, so
care must be taken to roll out with the proper AOD. Attacks should be planned to provide 5 seconds of
tracking/designate time prior to arriving at the release altitude. For CCIP deliveries, roll out with the
target approximately two thirds of the way down between the FPM and CCIP pipper.
 After releasing weapons, the threat will dictate the type of recovery, but for peacetime training recover with a 4–5 G pull until the nose is above the horizon then execute the egress plan.

Visual Level Delivery (VLD) (0º–5º)
This type of delivery is flown using CCIP when the weather or threat precludes steeper dive angles.
Ingress the target area at low altitude, terrain masking and constantly jinking until just prior to weapon
release. Since your approach to the target is a random flight path, good planning is required to arrive at
an action point where target acquisition is initiated and weapons delivery commenced. If a level delivery
is planned, simply arrive at the target on your proper altitude with the CCIP pipper properly positioned. If
a 5º diving delivery is planned, initiate a 10º pull-up followed by a pull-down/bunt approximately 500'
below planned apex. Pay particularly close attention to precise release parameters, fragmentation clearance and ground avoidance. The recovery portion of this delivery must be emphasized to ensure safe escape criteria from your munition. 





### <a name='SafeEscapeManeuversSEM'></a>Safe Escape Maneuvers (SEM)
Level Straight Through (LST)
This is the simplest of the SEMs and is exactly what its name suggests; safe escape is provided by a level, constant speed, no-turn profile. Maintain this SEM until 3 seconds after the TOF of the last bomb in the stick. This is only used with a level release, like the VLD you might use with MK-82AIRs.
 



Turning (TRN)
While the TRN SEM isn't often planned in the A-10, the tactical situation may dictate its use. It's valid for attacks using up to 20° of dive. After release, simultaneously apply MIL and establish a 4g loaded roll (60-85° of bank) in the desired direction. As the TVV nears 5° of dive increase your bank angle to maintain 4g and 5° of dive for at least 60° of heading change.
 

Turning Level Turn (TLT)
This is far more common than TRN, and is also used for deliveries with up to 20°. After release, simultaneously apply MIL power (MAX in the A-10) and establish a wings-level 4g pull within 2 seconds. As the TVV nears the horizon, perform a 2-4g loaded
roll in the desired direction and establish a 4g level turn for at least 60° of heading change.

 

Climb (CLM)
The CLM SEM can be used for attack profiles with as much as 60° of dive. After weapon release, establish a 4g pull within 2 seconds. As the nose approaches the horizon, apply MIL power  and maintain the 4g pull until the TVV is 20°above the horizon, and then relax the pull until the TVV indicates at least a 30° climb.

### <a name='ThreePointAttackBrief'></a>Three Point Attack Brief
The Three-Point -Attack  Brief  is the  standard  attack  briefing  designed to  give the information  needed  to  perform an attack quickly. The brief assumes that as a minimum the engaged fighter has acquired the  target, and is the minimum information considered necessary to execute an attack: 

**Initial Point (IP)**    
The point from where the attack starts. Can be a way-point, geographical feature or a holding area (wheel, racetrack). If no information is given, the attack is conducted from formation. 


**Method of Attack**  
Roles, Attack formation, and type of attack, weapon.

**Egress**  
Safe escape manoeuvre, egress direction or point. Can be a heading or a point like IP, and can contain  instructions for additional  attacks using the same brief.

#### <a name='AttackRoles'></a>Attack Roles  

**Shooter:** Primarily responsible for employing munitions on target.

**Cover:** Responsible for providing mutual support to the other flight member. Specific requirements for this role will be briefed by the flight lead.

**Marker:** Is assigned to a pilot who will employ the TGP during the attack. Pilots assigned this role can expect to mark the target with the laser and/or IR marker for target identification purposes and/or LGB guidance.

**Decoy:** Flight member’s primary responsibility is to create confusion, deny or delay enemy defences to keep them from engaging the attacking aircraft. 

#### <a name='Attacktypes'></a>Attack types

**Shooter-Cover**  
Here the  shooter  will focus on target acquisition and release of weapons  whilst  the  other  aircraft flying a cover role will  support the shooter  by:  
* Scanning visually for threats (smoke trails, traces, muzzle-flashes)  
* Scanning the RWR and Radar  
* Immediately  call  threats  to  the  other  aircraft,  and  a  directive  on  how  to  defeat  the  threat

**Shooter-Shooter**    
These are  attacks  where  both  aircraft  fire  weapons  during  the  same  attack  run.  This  attack  type  is  generally  reserved  for  “stand-off”  weapons such  as  Mavericks,  where  the  attacking  flight  does  not  overfly hostile  ground  or  fly  within  the  engagement  envelope  of  the  target.  I.e.,  the  flight  performs  a  trade-off  between  the  security  offered  by  having  a  dedicated  supporting  fighter  and  added  firepower  in  a  single  run.

Dive   
Can be employed from low altitude pop-up or medium/high altitude to deliver free-fall or forward firing munitions. The attack will provide the pilot with a planned time duration to track the target during delivery. 

Level  
Medium/high altitude level free-fall deliveries can be employed using CCIP or CCRP. Level deliveries at low altitude are used to deliver free-fall munitions when exposure time is a major concern and primarily used for high-drag munitions. Low-level ingress will make it difficult for the threat to detect and defend the attack.
But, target acquisition is very difficult. Three-dimensional maneuvering if required to defeat a threat can further complicate the attack run. Also, the miss distance for an aiming error in elevation or altitude source is greater for a level delivery than a dive. Plan a ripple delivery to offset the range error. Ensure delivery parameters account for weapon fuzing and SEM.

Toss/Loft  
Low altitude or pop-up from medium altitude deliveries employing free fall ordnance. The IFFCC is capable of performing DT deliveries in CCRP. DT allows reduced exposure time and higher recovery altitudes. Degraded accuracy can occur with DT due to the higher LOS rates created by the onset of G forces. Use ripple deliveries to help minimize errors but consider proximity to
friendly forces. Deliveries from medium altitude will increase weapon spacing while high sight depression will complicate the attack.


Mutual support Attack Geometry  
Cover pilots must consider the attack geometry when attacking from a medium altitude in order to provide continuous mutual support. Monitor the target area and “shooter” while maintaining turning room so you can roll-in if called upon to employ munitions. The most critical part of mutual support during an attack and recovery is visual. It is difficult for the attacking aircraft to clear its 6 o’clock while maneuvering off the target because of the higher delivery altitudes. Two methods to help reduce loss are:

Arcing the Target  
As the “shooter” rolls in the cover aircraft continues to arc the target. You must arc far enough away so the entire target area can be seen but close enough to maintain a visual on the “shooter” aircraft during roll-in and recover. A good technique is to keep the target area on the canopy rail, this permits a dive angle of approximately 45° if required to roll-in. When in trail or wedge prior to roll-in it will be difficult to use this technique since the “shooter” will be traveling away from your aircraft’s position. When possible, the cover aircraft will art toward the direction of the pull-off location of the “shooter. 
 

Parallel Attack Axis  
Similar to Arcing, the different is the “shooter” provides a verbal cue to clear the cover aircraft to maneuver parallel the attack axis. The verbal cue will be briefed prior to the attack either on the ground or in the air. The cover aircraft establishes a position to employ ordnance and monitor the target area and “shooter” during roll-in and pull-off. When the “shooter” pulls-off the cover aircraft will be in a predictable point aiding the “shooter” regaining visual. This will minimize “Blind” calls from the “cover” or “shooter.”
