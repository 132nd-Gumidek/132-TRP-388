## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification.
Once all objctives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This mission is conducted with a minimum of 3 flights. (Flights can be singleships). 

MQ pilots will plan, prepare and brief a SCAR mission, using the SCAR TTP.  1 flight will be the training flight doing SCAR. The other two flights are
regular AR flights. SCAR flight will takeoff first, establish SA and provide SCAR briefing to AR flights as they check-in.
During the mission, one flight will head for the tanker or go off station for a period, the SCAR flight will use the battle handover brief to provide SA when they return. 
After mission is complete and during RTB, flights will give a inflightreport to AWACS or to eachother if no AWACS controller is availeble.


Range 1 and Range 2A are good for the excution of this mission. (Use F10 to dynamicly setup the range. In order to activate the range, 
Find Range 1 or Range 2 storage, move the vehicle close to the windmarker and the Range options are availeble in the F10 menu).

If availeble, coordinate with another pilot/controller to setup the range, in order to increase the training value.
