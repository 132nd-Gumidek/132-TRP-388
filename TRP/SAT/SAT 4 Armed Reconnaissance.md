## Lesson Content
This lesson is conducted as a self-qualification.
Once all objctives are met, you must self-qualify this lesson.

This mission is conducted as a 2-ship flight (minmum) or a 4-ship flight.

MQ pilots will plan, prepare and brief a AR mission, using one of the search methods described in the TTP.
During the mission, one pilot or one element will head for the tanker, and the flight will use the battle handover brief to provide SA when they switch roles. After mission is complete and during RTB, pilots will give a inflightreport to AWACS or to eachother if no AWACS controller is availeble.


Range 1 and Range 2A aregood for the excution of this mission. (Use F10 to dynamicly setup the range. In order to activate the range, Find Range 1 or Range 2 storage, move the vehicle close to the windmarker and the Range options are availeble in the F10 menu).

If availeble, coordinate with another pilot/controller to setup the range, in order to increase the training value.
