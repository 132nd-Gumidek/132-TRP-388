## Instructor Preparation
- Coordinate with another IP/MQ pilot to support the lesson as aggressor. (Ideal is 2, so the aggressors can do various maneuvers)
- Book necessary airspace to conduct the lesson.
- Prepare theory brief with most important topics.
- Prepare Mission briefing.
- Prepare Mission Data Card


## Lesson Content
This lesson will start by the IP holding a theory brief/mission brief for the flight.
Once in pit, pilots (IP/FL and Trainee/WM) will startup according to 388th SOP.
Once ready, pilots will conduct a trail departure.
The flight will fly to airspace intended for the BVR training, and start setups IAW IPs directions.


The trainee will fly as #1 during taxi, take-off and departure, until established in the MOA where FL will resume position as #1
After the WVR training have been completed, trainee will resume position as #1 and lead the flight back for an approach
and landing back at home base. Intention for this is to increase training value for trainees and give trainee necessary confidence
and practice to operate radios and fly as a singleship


## Debrief
The Instructor Pilot should evaluate the students ability to understand, perform and train the following:
- Trainee able to communicate effeciently.
- Trainee able to maintain SA.
- Trainee able to function as engaged fighter and supporting fighter.
