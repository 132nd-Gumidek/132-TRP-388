## Lesson Title
ACM - 1v1 WVR Manoeuvring (IP)

## Required Lessons
TAC-01

## Lesson Type
IP Mandatory

## Topics
Building a solid understanding of basic ACM

## Objectives
* Objective 1: Can find the enemy after a merge in the following scenarios:
* Objective 1.1: Level two circle
* Objective 1.2: Level one circle
* Objective 1.3: Two circle enemy goes high
* Objective 1.4: Two circle enemy goes low
* Objective 1.5: One circle enemy goes high
* Objective 1.6: One circle enemy goes low

* Objective 2: Can recognise the correct energy state to counter the enemy's manoeuvring
* Objective 3: Trainee can safely fly as #1 during departure and approach

## Trainee Preparation
- Read 132-TTP-Air-to-Air-1 v1.0: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mxjw8q1idcxsi8q/132-TTP-AA-1.pdf?dl=0
Focus on chapter 9, Within Visual Range


## Instructor Preparation
- Book necessary airspace to conduct the lesson.
- Prepare theory brief with most important topics.
- Prepare Mission briefing.
- Prepare Mission Data Card.


## Lesson Content
This lesson will start by the IP holding a theory brief/mission brief for the flight.
Once in pit, pilots (IP/FL and Trainee/WM) will startup according to 388th SOP and checklist.
Once ready, pilots will conduct a fomation departure.
The flight will fly to airspace intended for the ACM training, and start with merges.
If/when needed the flight will head to the tanker to AAR.
The flight will continue to fly merges
If required, the flight will return to the tanker for an additional AAR.
The flight will continue merges until objective have been met before RTB.

The trainee will fly as #1 during taxi, take-off and departure, until established in the MOA where FL will resume position as #1
After the WVR training have been completed, trainee will resume position as #1 and lead the flight back for an approach
and landing back at home base. Intention for this is to increase training value for trainees and give trainee necessary confidence
and practice to operate radios and fly as a singleship


## Debrief
The Instructor Pilot should evaluate the students ability to understand, perform and train the following:
- Trainee able to find the enemy after a merge.
- Trainees ability to fly in #1 position
