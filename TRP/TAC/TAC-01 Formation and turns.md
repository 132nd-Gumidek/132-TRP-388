Ensure that the 388th Kneeboard Pack is correctly placed into the kneeboard folder.
Familiarise yourself with the over-head break as desribed in the 388th Sqn. Training Manual.

## Instructor Preparation:
- Prepare theory brief with most important topics
- Prepare Mission briefing
- Prepare Mission Data Card
- Ensure weather on the server is suitable for a formation take-off




## Lesson content:
This lesson will start by the IP holding a theory brief/mission brief for the flight.
Once in pit, pilots (IP/FL and Trainee/WM) will startup according to 388th SOP and checklist.
The flight will taxi staggered in this training. Once ready, pilots will conduct a fomation departure.
The flight will then set course to a MOA or any other availeble big block of airspace and will run through the various formations, making sure that the trainee knows the correct wingman position in all formations.
After formation practice, the flight will head to the tanker to do AAR.
The second part is to conduct turns.
On completion, the flight will return to the airbase and conduct a overhead break landing.

## Debrief:
The Instructor Pilot should evaluate the students ability to understand, perform and train the following:
- All formations
- All turns
