# Standard Contract

## Why

Having the standard contract in a seperate document allows for quick changes to what is standard. And allows for MDC's, Briefs and SOP to reference to STD. End-game here is a single knee-board sized page for easy ref.

## Relies on

Knowledge about contract, and different types of contracts, standard, briefed, in-flight.

## NECK COMMENT
We already have this in the kneeboard (or it should be part of the kneeboard package, but not fully developed yet). Suggest not to have an extra document 
as we then potentially get it in many version and harder to maintain. 
Suggest it is only listed in the Kneeboard, with reference in the SOPs or the other way around. General knowledge about contract should be in training manual.
