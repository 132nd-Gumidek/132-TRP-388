Not organised or vetted :)

checklist.  
## Check-list: Verify Cockpit 
throttle off (throttle check movement & off)  

## Check-list: Before Engine Start  
radios set & check in (only have manual control of radio?, unless we change to GND pwr start)

## After Engine Start   
dtc load (is that a thing? cartridge right? need to indicate stuff w/o meaning, other color or italic)

mfl reset ? (need to read manual)

gear level _ check (check down + indicators?)

fuel qnt - set (test and set?)

## After Engine Start (cont)  
threat warning aux: on (is this volume, i prefer low/nil until fence checks?, )

SJ preset (does this work?)

AIR REFUEL SWITCH.... CYCLE & CHECK (HOW TO CHECK?)  

MISSING ITEMS?
